# COP290 - Design Course - Task2

This assignment is based on making a game that can be played by 2 players over the Internet. It had to be a graphics game so we used SDL and some C++ libraries. 
The instructions for playing the game is below.


Readme

1) Type sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-net-dev
2) We ran the code on Ubuntu VM and we had 2 different folders for SDL client and SDL server.
3) We used the links that Ma'am gave on the site, mainly lazyfoo.net along with https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/socket-programming-cc/ for socket programming, canvas for designing and Google Maps to get the maze structure.
