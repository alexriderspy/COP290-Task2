A word of advice for all the tasks: 
1)The entry and exit to the rooms are marked distinctly. You need to follow them to get your tasks recognised.
2)Some of the tiles are really old so their magic may have diminished, you might need to try a number of times walking on the entry/exit tiles to get in/out. Do not freak out! Be strong! The strong shall win and the weak shall perish.

1) You will have to verify that you are a student of IITD. Go to LH-108 first and verify your documents. 
2) Great, now you have to go to LH-116 to submit your documents
3) Fine, now go to LH-408 to get your ID card
4) Okay, now go to LH-416 to get your medical booklet
5) Finally your work in LHC is done, you will see your next task soon, all the best!



1) There are 2 shops with healthy food, and others all serve poisonous food. You have to decide which shop to go to. If you eat healthy food, you will live long, but if you eat poisonous food, you may die. Best of luck on your endeavour!
Okay so, you have had food, and now you are ready to run. Take a round of the football ground aka the cemetary, avoid the death pools and zombies out there and get back out as soon as you can. All the best
