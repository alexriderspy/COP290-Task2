1) Horror - I can make tiles behave spookily, unnatural lights, dark theme, characters as simple humans, yulu normal, profs zombies, dogs dead but moving, guards normal trying to save us, we shall have shields to begin with and then guards will give us shields, with a cost of time, you have to draw characters, not get from internet please, other groups who have people who can draw well, have designed the characters themselves, pls do that, make 2 males, 2 females, guards, ghosts, suddenly popping up ghosts, that suddenly become visible and take away one live and get u back to the last checkpoint

2) Adventure - here we can incorporate horror in a small part, jaha we shall keep ghosts and zombies, maybe in ground or lawn, where going to is compulsory, but we shall have humans as characters, make one with maybe proper girls and proper boys (i think creatures would possibly be a little weird considering like we are fighting against zombies and creatures so think it over) we can add eagle as an attacker, and here guards would also give us shields, we could have coins suddenly popping up staying for some time and then disappearing, same with shields

3) Disney - here, we could choose characters as rapunzel, cinderella, prince, so we could weave a story, as in like take cinderella for example, we could have dwarfs and fairy god mother and maybe even her bad sisters, who could take away points, prince could give her a life and so on
